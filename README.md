# dotfiles
My dotfiles for Configs.

Within this repo are dotfiles for all programs where they have been modified from their defaults.
These include:
- abcde
- i3 (Gaps)
- Polybar
- Rofi
- More to come soon...

# Dependencies
Most of the dependencies are included but some packages need to be installed for everything to work as planned.
These include:
- rofi
- i3-gaps
- polybar
- abcde
- trizen (For Arch-Based Distros)
- network-manager
- blurlock
- xfce4-power-manager
- thunar
- lxterminal
- nitrogen
- oh-my-bash
- ...

You will need to source these yourself, as instructions vary by distro. Having said that, some or all of these packages should be included in your distro's repositories.

Download the [setup.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Conjuam/dotfiles/master/setup.sh) file (add execute permissions if necessary) then run (NOT AS SUDO!). Follow the instructions and then make sure log out and log back in. Dotfiles should now be applied.
